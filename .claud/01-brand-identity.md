# Werewolves & Unicorns - Brand Identity

## Official Brand Positioning (LOCKED IN)

**Name:** Werewolves & Unicorns

**Tagline:** "Discover your AI personality. Master the skills that matter."

**Tagline Variations:**
- Short: "Your AI personality. Your skill journey."
- Extended: "Discover if you're a Werewolf, Unicorn, or something in between—while mastering the AI skills employers actually want."

## Positioning Statement

Werewolves & Unicorns is a Duolingo-style platform for AI skills with personality discovery as the viral hook.

**FROM:** Educational AI prompting tool with gamification
**TO:** AI skill-building platform with personality discovery and optional competition (Duolingo model)

## Key Principles

1. **Skills & Personality Together** - Real AI skills with personality discovery as the engagement hook
2. **Broader Than Prompting** - Focus on "AI skills" not just "AI prompting"
3. **Competition is Optional** - Like Duolingo's leagues (visible but not required)
4. **Viral by Design** - "What's your AI personality?" drives social sharing
5. **Dual Audience** - Job seekers (skill building) + Employers (talent marketplace)

## The Duolingo Model

**Core Loop:**
- Daily skill challenges (everyone)
- Personality progression (Wolf ↔ Unicorn spectrum)
- XP and leveling (visible progress)

**Optional Competition:**
- Weekly leagues
- Leaderboards
- Head-to-head battles
- Team challenges

**Like Duolingo:**
- You don't have to compete to learn
- Competition creates social pressure (FOMO)
- Casual and hardcore paths coexist
- Streaks and habits drive retention

## Brand Tone

- **Friendly but competitive** - Welcoming to beginners, exciting for achievers
- **Playful but credible** - Fun personality framework, real career outcomes
- **Personal but professional** - Identity discovery, job market value
- **Engaging but optional** - Can play casually or compete seriously

## Visual Identity Notes

- Wolf and unicorn mascot heads (friendly, not aggressive)
- Embrace W&U duality in logo/branding
- Spectrum/transformation symbolism
- Gaming aesthetics for competitive features
- Professional enough for B2B contexts
- NEVER use emojis or icons in documentation

## The Pitch

**To Job Seekers:** "Discover your AI personality while building skills employers actually want"

**To Employers:** "Find talent verified through competitive skill challenges, not just resumes"

**To Investors:** "Duolingo for AI skills with personality quiz virality and B2B marketplace revenue"

## What Makes It Viral

1. **Personality Quiz Hook** - "What's your AI personality?" is instantly shareable
2. **Social Identity** - "I'm a Shapeshifter Level 47" has flex appeal
3. **Competitive Drama** - League promotions/demotions create moments worth sharing
