## 1. Square Icon Version

**Filename: logo-icon.png and logo-icon.svg**

I need you to create a square app icon version of this logo. Requirements:

- Square format (1024x1024px recommended)
- **Transparent background** (no white background)
- Center the wolf and unicorn heads closer together to fit the square format
- Maintain all colors and style from the reference
- Ensure both heads are fully visible with balanced spacing
- Add minimal padding around the edges (about 10% of canvas size)
- Keep the friendly, mascot style
- Optimize for small sizes (must be recognizable at 16x16px)

IMPORTANT: If the detailed mascot heads don't work at small sizes, provide abstract alternatives:
- Simplified head silhouettes (just outlines, no facial features)
- Geometric shapes representing wolf (angular/triangle) and unicorn (curved with horn)
- Interlocking "W" and "U" letterforms in teal and orange
- Abstract yin-yang style design with teal and orange

## 2. Horizontal Lockup with Text

**Filename: logo-horizontal.png and logo-horizontal.svg**

Create a horizontal logo lockup combining the mascot heads with text. Requirements:

- Place the wolf and unicorn heads on the left
- Add "WEREWOLVES & UNICORNS" text to the right in a modern, friendly sans-serif font
- Use charcoal (#2C3E50) for the text
- Maintain 2:1 or 3:1 aspect ratio (wider than tall)
- Keep consistent spacing between heads and text
- Align text vertically centered with the mascot heads
- Ensure text is clearly legible
- **Transparent background**

If the full mascot heads are too detailed for the height, consider:
- Simplified head silhouettes
- Just the head outlines without facial details
- Abstract wolf/unicorn symbols with text

## 6. Social Media Cover/Banner

## 7. Favicon (Multiple Sizes)

**Filename: favicon.ico and favicon.svg**

Create a favicon optimized for 16x16px to 32x32px display. Requirements:

At these tiny sizes, the detailed mascot heads will NOT work. Use abstract alternatives:

OPTION 1 (Recommended): Yin-yang inspired design
- Circular design with teal and orange in a balanced swirl/yin-yang pattern
- Symbolizes the duality and spectrum concept
- Instantly recognizable at tiny sizes

OPTION 2: Geometric abstract
- Simple shapes: angular triangle (wolf) + curved horn shape (unicorn)
- Minimal, iconic representation

OPTION 3: Lettermark
- Stylized "W&U" or interlocking W and U
- Use teal and orange colors

OPTION 4: Split circle
- Circle divided diagonally or vertically
- Teal on one side, orange on the other

Choose the option that works best at 16x16px. The design MUST be clearly visible and recognizable at favicon size.

**Transparent background**

## Why SVG Matters

SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files are essential for:
- Perfect scaling at any size without quality loss
- Smaller file sizes for web performance
- Easy color modifications in code
- Crisp display on retina/high-DPI screens
- Flexibility for future design needs

Always request SVG versions alongside PNG files when ChatGPT can provide them.
