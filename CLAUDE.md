# Werewolves & Unicorns - Project Guide for Claude Code

## Project Overview
Duolingo-style platform for AI skills with personality discovery as the viral hook. Users discover their W&U personality type (analytical Werewolf â†” creative Unicorn spectrum) while mastering valuable AI skills through gamified daily challenges and optional competitive leagues.

## Brand Positioning (LOCKED IN)

**Name:** Werewolves & Unicorns

**Tagline:** "Discover your AI personality. Master the skills that matter."

**Model:** Duolingo for AI skills
- Daily skill challenges (core loop)
- Personality discovery (viral hook)
- Optional competitive leagues (retention)
- Professional portfolios (career value)

**Key Principles:**
1. **Skills First, Personality Hook** - Build real AI skills, discover personality along the way
2. **Broader Than Prompting** - Focus on "AI skills" not just "AI prompting"
3. **Competition is Optional** - Like Duolingo's leagues (visible but not required)
4. **Viral by Design** - "What's your AI personality?" drives social sharing
5. **Dual Value** - Job seekers (skill building) + Employers (talent marketplace)
