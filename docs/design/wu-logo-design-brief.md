# Werewolves & Unicorns Logo Design Brief

## Context & Purpose

You are designing the logo for **Werewolves & Unicorns**, an AI personality discovery platform with competitive skill-building mechanics. This logo will be the primary visual identity across web, mobile, social media, and marketing materials.

## Brand Identity

**Name:** Werewolves & Unicorns
**Tagline:** "Discover your AI personality. Master the skills that matter."

**Core Concept:** Users discover their AI interaction personality on a 7-level spectrum from analytical "Werewolf" to creative "Unicorn" while building valuable AI skills through gamified challenges and optional competitive leagues.

**Brand Personality:**
- Friendly but competitive
- Playful but credible
- Personal but professional
- Educational with gaming energy
- Approachable to beginners, exciting for achievers

## Design Requirements

### Must-Have Elements

1. **Dual Nature Representation**
   - Visual representation of both werewolf and unicorn
   - Show spectrum/transformation concept between the two
   - Balanced treatment (neither side dominant)
   - Can be literal creatures OR abstract symbolism

2. **Technical Specifications**
   - SVG format (vector graphics)
   - Flat design aesthetic (no gradients except where specified)
   - Works in both light and dark modes
   - Scalable from 16px (favicon) to large format
   - Clean, simple shapes

3. **Color Palette**
   - Primary: Teal (#2D7D7D) and Orange (#E67E22)
   - Accent: Can incorporate spectrum gradient (Crimson #8B0000 → Fuchsia #FF00FF) if appropriate
   - Must work in: Full color, monochrome, single color
   - Background options: Transparent, Cream (#F8F9FA), Dark (#1A1A1A)

4. **Typography Considerations** (if text included)
   - Modern, friendly sans-serif
   - Readable at small sizes
   - Optional: Can be icon-only OR wordmark OR combination
   - If abbreviated: "W&U" acceptable

### Style Reference

**Previous Robot Logo (for style inspiration only):**
The original "Prompt Pilot" logo featured a friendly robot mascot with a graduation cap, using teal and orange colors in a clean, flat design style. While we're moving away from robot imagery, we should maintain:
- The friendly, approachable aesthetic
- Clean, flat design with simple shapes
- Teal and orange color scheme
- Rounded, non-aggressive forms
- Educational but playful tone
- Works well as an icon/avatar

**DO:**
- Embrace duality/transformation theme
- Use clean, geometric shapes (similar simplicity to the robot logo)
- Create memorable silhouette
- Ensure instant recognizability
- Design for versatility (app icon, website header, social media)
- Consider how it looks when animated/in motion
- Maintain the friendly, accessible vibe of the original

**DON'T:**
- Use robot imagery (we're pivoting away from that)
- Make it too complex (must work at 16px)
- Rely on fine details or textures
- Create something that feels childish or overly aggressive
- Use more than 3-4 colors in primary version
- Lose the approachable friendliness of the original style

## Design Concepts to Explore

### Option A: Dual Silhouette
- Werewolf and unicorn profiles facing each other
- Negative space creates meaningful shape between them
- Could form letters "W" and "U"
- Clean, iconic approach

### Option B: Transformation Symbol
- Single creature morphing from wolf to unicorn
- Gradient or split design showing spectrum
- Abstract representation of change/growth
- More conceptual, sophisticated

### Option C: Spectrum Badge
- Shield or circular badge format
- Wolf on one side, unicorn on other
- Spectrum gradient connecting them
- Gaming/achievement aesthetic
- Could include "W&U" typography

### Option D: Abstract Mark
- Geometric shapes representing analytical vs. creative
- Interlocking or complementary forms
- More corporate/professional
- Symbolic rather than literal

### Option E: Playful Mascots
- Friendly, simplified wolf and unicorn characters
- Side-by-side or interacting
- Approachable, educational vibe
- Could be graduation cap incorporated
- More literal but memorable

## Output Requirements

### Deliverables Needed

For each logo concept, provide:

1. **Primary Logo** (SVG code)
   - Full color version
   - Optimized for web/digital use
   - Clean, commented SVG markup

2. **Variations**
   - Icon-only version (square format)
   - Horizontal lockup (logo + wordmark if applicable)
   - Monochrome version
   - Inverted version (for dark backgrounds)

3. **Usage Notes**
   - Minimum size recommendations
   - Clear space requirements
   - Do's and don'ts for implementation
   - Which version for which context

### Design Process

**Step 1:** Generate 3-5 distinct logo concepts based on different approaches above

**Step 2:** For each concept, explain:
- Design rationale (why this approach fits the brand)
- How it represents the W&U duality
- Scalability considerations
- Versatility across use cases

**Step 3:** Allow for iteration:
- User selects favorite concept(s)
- Refine based on feedback
- Create variations and alternates
- Polish final version

**Step 4:** Document final logo:
- Export clean SVG files
- Provide usage guidelines
- Create style guide entry
- Prepare for asset library

## Success Criteria

A successful logo will:
- ✅ Instantly communicate the W&U duality concept
- ✅ Be memorable and distinctive (not generic)
- ✅ Work across all sizes and contexts
- ✅ Align with flat, friendly design aesthetic
- ✅ Feel both professional and playful
- ✅ Be ownable (unique to this brand)
- ✅ Support the viral "personality discovery" hook
- ✅ Scale for future brand extensions

## Reference Points

- Educational but not boring

## Additional Context

**Platform Features to Consider:**
- 5 visual progression tiers (Bronze → Diamond)
- Weekly competitive leagues (optional)
- Achievement badges and streaks
- Portfolio building for job seekers
- B2B employer marketplace

**Target Audiences:**
- Primary: Job seekers learning AI skills (25-40 years old)

- Tertiary: AI enthusiasts and competitive learners

**Competitive Landscape:**
- Differentiate from: Generic AI course platforms, robot-themed tools
- Align with: Personality-driven experiences, skill verification platforms

## Constraints & Considerations

**Technical:**

Take time to explore multiple directions before committing. The goal is to create something that will represent Werewolves & Unicorns for years to come while remaining flexible enough to evolve with the platform.
