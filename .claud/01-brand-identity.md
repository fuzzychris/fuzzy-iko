# Werewolves & Unicorns - Brand Identity

## Official Brand Positioning (LOCKED IN)

**Name:** Werewolves & Unicorns

**Tagline:** "Discover your AI personality. Master the skills that matter."

**Tagline Variations:**
- Short: "Your AI personality. Your skill journey."
- Extended: "Discover if you're a Werewolf, Unicorn, or something in betweenâ€”while mastering the AI skills employers actually want."

## Positioning Statement

Werewolves & Unicorns is an AI personality discovery platform with competitive skill-building mechanics (Duolingo model for AI skills).

**FROM:** Educational AI prompting tool with gamification
**TO:** AI personality-first platform where users discover their W&U type while mastering valuable AI skills

## Key Principles

1. **Personality-First** - W&U framework is the main viral hook, not a side feature
2. **Broader Than Prompting** - Focus on "AI skills" not just "AI prompting"
3. **Competition is Optional** - Like Duolingo's leagues (visible but not required)
4. **Viral by Design** - "What's your AI personality?" drives social sharing
5. **Dual Audience** - Job seekers (skill building) + Employers (talent marketplace)

## Brand Tone

- **Friendly but competitive** - Welcoming to beginners, exciting for achievers
- **Playful but credible** - Fun fantasy theme, real career outcomes
- **Personal but professional** - Identity discovery, job market value

## Visual Identity Notes

- NO generic robot mascots
- Embrace W&U duality in logo/branding
- Spectrum/transformation symbolism
- Gaming aesthetics for competitive features
- Professional enough for B2B contexts
- NEVER use emojis or icons in documentation
